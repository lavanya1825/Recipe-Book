Creating the HTML and CSS code you provided involves several steps. Here's a brief method to guide you through the process:

1. Set Up the HTML Structure:-

Start with a basic HTML template including <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Inside the <head>, include meta tags for character set and viewport settings, and link to any stylesheets or scripts if necessary.
Create a <header> for the title of your project.
Use a <div> to contain the animated character and recipe card.
    
   2. Add CSS Styles:-
    
Use CSS to style the body, header, and other elements. Set background colors, fonts, and layout properties.
Create animations using @keyframes for the typing effect and the walking animation of the character.
Style the recipe card with properties for layout, colors, and transitions.
        
3. Create the Animated Character:-
        
Use <div> elements to represent different parts of the character (head, body, arms, legs).
Apply CSS animations to these elements to create a walking effect.
        
       4. Create the Animated Character:-
        
Use <div> elements to represent different parts of the character (head, body, arms, legs).
Apply CSS animations to these elements to create a walking effect.
4. Implement the Recipe Card
Create a JavaScript array to hold recipe data (title, image, ingredients, steps).
Use a function to render the recipe card dynamically based on the current recipe index.
        
         5.Add JavaScript for Interactivity:-
          
Write JavaScript to handle the animation of the character and the display of recipes.
Use setTimeout and requestAnimationFrame to control the timing of animations and transitions.
Implement a loop to cycle through the recipes, updating the displayed recipe after a set duration.
          
6. Test and Refine:-
Test the code in a web browser to ensure that animations and transitions work as expected.
Refine styles and animations based on the visual output and user experience.
